\hspace{1pc}This paper delves into the application of the BID model in brain-inspired autonomous driving. The model aims to replicate how pathways in the brain's visual and decision-making regions process information, aiming to boost the interpretability and robustness of autonomous driving systems by mimicking biological neural mechanisms. Apart from visual cue perception, the BID model focuses on optimizing decision-making strategies by simulating the release of dopamine to achieve higher reward signals. This dopamine-mimicking approach helps autonomous driving systems balance risks and rewards intelligently in complex traffic, ultimately enhancing safety and robustness.
